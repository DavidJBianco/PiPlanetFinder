# PiPlanetFinder

The PiPlanetFinder is a gadget that uses the Raspberry Pi 3, GPS and a Sense Hat to allow you to select from a basic menu of planets and other features in the night sky, then uses simple graphics to help guide you to "point" right to where that object is in the sky at your location just at that time.

This repo contains the Python code to make it all work together.  For a more complete description of the project or just to see the current progress, see the project page at https://hackaday.io/project/27273-pi-planet-finder.
